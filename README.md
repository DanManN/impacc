## README

Collision Scene.

## PotentialCollisions()


- [x] Borrow KdTree and implemented [Daniel]

  (by yanshi) Note: on my computer I have to copy the `KdTree\KdTreeLib` into `Assert`  to make things works. 

- [ ] Draw debug lines

- [ ] Efficiency report

### CheckCollision()

- [ ] GJK algorithm
  - [ ] Ref: http://www.dyn4j.org/2010/04/gjk-gilbert-johnson-keerthi/
- [ ] penetration depth vector, EPA algorithm
  - [ ] Ref: http://www.dyn4j.org/2010/05/epa-expanding-polytope-algorithm/
